# Introduction
This program was developed for engineering students who want to go above and beyond the cirriculum set by VTU. Whether you want to be an entrepreneur, want to get a high paying job or just curious; this program will provide you with the skill sets required in the modern software world.

## Why This is Important

According to [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/engineering-employment-problems-329022-2016-07-13),[HackerEarth](http://www.hackerearth.com/blog/talent-assessment/90-indian-engineering-candidates-employable-why/) and other sources, a large percentage of engineers are unemployable when they graduate because they lack the necessary skills required by companies and corporations. The truth is that world of Computer Science and Engineering changes rapidly, and while the standard VTU syllabus covers the basics (which is very important), we need **something more** to enable students to be able to build amazing products that adhere to standards, collaborate better and share what they know.

This program aims to be that **something more**.
## Why we prioritize Projects and Github profiles

## The Holy Trinity (According to us....)
Below is some data and studies done by Hackerrank and Github:

![image](/img/Slide6.PNG)

- **Java** because it can be used anywhere. Server back-ends, Android apps, desktop software, networking apps, web apps, etc . If written properly, Java can be amazing to use.
- **Python** because it's easy to learn and even easier to use. Most of us use python for data scraping and analysis, but using a Framework like Django or Flask allows you to develop web apps as well. 
- **JavaScript** to build responsive web apps. Node.js lets you write JavaScript for the back-end. React Native lets you build cross platform web UIs. Building modern web apps is impossible without an advanced understanding of JavaScript.

## What you'll learn (beyond code)

- Collaboration with other people
- Following coding standards
- Team Management
- Testing
- Agile Development methods (Extreme Programming)

## Resources
- No laptop? No problem! Download [Dcoder](http://dcoder.tech/) for Android. But it's recommended you get a laptop or PC soon. 
- [Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/) (Don't pay for a nano degree. That's our advice.)
- [FreeCodeCamp for web development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Prefer textbooks to videos?](https://pastebin.com/1x0zS15y)
- [CodeMonk](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/codemonk/)
- HackerEarth for competitive programming
- HackerRank for competitive programming
- For inspiration watch:
	1. Silicon Valley (Comedy)
	2. Mr. Robot (Drama)
## ID card perks

Your ID card can get you some really expensive software for free. Check out these links. Use the school ID card option to sign up. 
- [Github Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us)
- [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)
- [JetBrains student pack](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) get this only for pro software versions of PyCharm and IntelliJ. If you'd like to code professionally in C++, PHP or JavaScript use this pack for those languages as well. Mostly wait till year 3.

# IDEs

1. **Visual Studio**

Get these Plugins: (Search for these in the extensions toolbar)

- Code Runner
-   HTML Snippets
- Python
- npm (download node.js first. `npm` is required for React) 
- Java

2. **PyCharm Community Edition**
It's free and it's the best out there.

3. **IntelliJ IDEA**

# A Note Before We Begin
**You can search udacity for each topic mentioned in the table of contents**
**Books are provided in the semester 4/5/6/7 directory**

Even though most of the things mentioned here are neatly divided into semesters, you'll find along the way that a lot of them overlap into each other. For example, you may chose to submit an android app in semester 4 itself. Or you may find that the application you want to build requires knowledge from a different semester.

`Nothing worth doing is easy`. There are times when you may want to quit. At those times, dig deep, take a walk, go to bed and come back to your problem later. The key thing here is to `never give up`.

# Semester 3/4

PHP is optional but we suggest you learn it so that you can quickly build web apps to test out ideas. You can also use Java if you think you'll need to scale quickly.

What's the fastest way to teach someone to swim? You push them into a pool and give them five minutes. Sounds brutal right? It's emphasizes `learn fast or die` which is what you're going to be doing this semester. (along with those other things)

You're on your own this semester. No help from your seniors besides the resources provided. We expect a good **project** (notice how the word **mini** is missing) that solves a problem you face, no matter how small it may be. You can work in alone or in a  team of 4. We recommend you work alone for now.

Here are the guidelines for projects:
- If it's a web app, we expect a url (a domain name can be obtained from the github student pack). Don't send us the code and have us run it. It has to be mobile ready.

- If it's a Desktop app, we want an installer. Installers can be hosted on the releases portion of github.

- Code should be publicly visible on github and must be commented properly. 

Make the project and you're in. Don't worry if you didn't make it, since you can still follow this guide to it's end.

# Semester 5
In Semester 5, we'll focus on building android apps with Java. Recommended Guide is the Android developers program by Google on Udacity. If you still want to read, a few books have been provided in the semester 5 directory. Android is hard and the best way to learn is to build an app. Want ideas? Ask anybody. No seriously.

You'll also be learning how to build reactive web apps using React and Redux. Why React? It's easier to learn and makes web apps extremely modular by turning them into components. Again mastering React is a matter of experience so try and build something with it.

You'll also need to work on and maintain some of CSE department apps that have been built by your seniors.

Same rules for the projects apply. **It's now mandatory to work in a team of 4 for a project**.

# Semester 6

Alright! You've learnt how to build some fancy stuff by now, hopefully. Now it's time to share them with the world.

Machine Learning can be implemented using Python or Java, though python is recommended. The textbook uses R though, to teach fundamental concepts. Don't Panic.

Semester 6 is all about the Cloud. We'll start with AWS EC2, move on to other AWS products, learn about Docker (Containers) and Kubernetes for managing docker containers. Learn how to scale apps based on user requirements.

Finally, you'll learn how to use the PAAS solution Heroku for deploying and scaling applications. Even though it's optional we suggest you take a look at it as it is simplifies your deployment process.

# Overview

![overview](/img/Slide10.PNG)
# Why no semester 7 or 8?

This is where you should focus on internships, getting placed, Entrance exams, etc. We've left out this section so that you can learn whatever you want. Once you get here, it's your job to help out your juniors with the knowledge you've obtained from this program.

This document is a collaborative effort and is meant to be changed and modified with the times. This is also your responsibility. The more community collaboration we have on this project, the better it will be.

# Project Ideas

- check out this [link](https://github.com/karan/Projects)
- Also Smart India Hackathon might give you some ideas. Search and go through something you might find interesting. [link](https://innovate.mygov.in/sih2018/)
- Asking friends also helps.
- We'll update here as we find interesting project ideas.

# Applications We've Built

- ### PHPCrawler
	Gets VTU results for all semesters and stores it in a xlsx file for the department.

- ### Pycrawler
	Gets VTU results for all semesters and stores it in a xlsx file for the department.

- ### docx2db
	A script that converts time tables stored in .docx format into a sqlite database that can be used with the BITCSE app.

- ### BITCSE
	An Android app built to view time tables, events happening at college, attendance, marks and other tools. Right now it only shows time tables and faculty details but we plan to update it with further help.
